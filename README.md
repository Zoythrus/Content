Millénaire is a Minecraft mod that aims to fill the "emptiness" left by the default Minecraft Villages by adding new NPC villages loosely based on 11th-century cultures. A village is populated by men, women, and children that each lives their own life and have their own story to tell.

## Content
The main part of Millénaire that works with the source code to provide what you see in game. This include schematics, textures, and similar items. This is where different styles of Millénaire come into play, and there can be multiple different branches per version of the mod. Customization is the biggest part in this repo, so contact Zoythrus if you're interested in helping out. Pull requests welcome! (As always, quickest contact on Discord).
